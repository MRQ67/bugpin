# Development Plan: BugPin üìåüêõ

This document outlines the development plan, feature list, and suggested improvements for the "BugPin" project.

## 1. Project Overview

A social platform where developers can upload, share, and organize screenshots of coding errors. The mission is to make debugging collaborative and to help users find solutions to similar bugs.

- **Tagline:** "Pin Your Pain"
- **Mission:** Where bugs become beautiful and debugging becomes collaborative.

## 2. Core Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15.5 with App Router + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase (Database, Auth, Storage)
- **Image Processing:** Direct image upload and storage

## 3. Database Schema

The database uses Supabase and consists of the following tables with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled:
- `profiles`: Extends `auth.users` with public user data.
- `error_posts`: The core table for storing uploaded errors and images.
- `comments`: For comments on error posts.
- `likes`: To track user likes on posts.
