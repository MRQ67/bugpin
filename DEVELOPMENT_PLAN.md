# Development Plan: BugPin üìåüêõ

This document outlines the development plan, feature list, and suggested improvements for the "BugPin" project.

## 1. Project Overview

A social platform where developers can upload, share, and organize screenshots of coding errors. The mission is to make debugging collaborative and to help users find solutions to similar bugs.

- **Tagline:** "Pin Your Pain"
- **Mission:** Where bugs become beautiful and debugging becomes collaborative.

## 2. Core Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15.5 with App Router + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase (Database, Auth, Storage)
- **Image Processing:** Direct image upload and storage

## 3. Database Schema

The database uses Supabase and consists of the following tables with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled:
- `profiles`: Extends `auth.users` with public user data.
- `error_posts`: The core table for storing uploaded errors and images.
- `comments`: For comments on error posts.
- `likes`: To track user likes on posts.

#### K. ‚úÖ Remove OCR Functionality - Simplify and Improve Reliability (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Remove OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality to simplify the codebase, improve reliability, and reduce complexity for users.

**‚úÖ Implementation Completed:**
OCR functionality has been successfully removed from the project to improve simplicity and reliability.

**‚úÖ Benefits Achieved:**
- **Faster Uploads**: No waiting for OCR processing
- **Better Reliability**: Eliminated OCR failure points
- **Simpler Codebase**: Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead
- **Better Mobile Experience**: No resource-intensive processing on mobile devices
- **Improved User Experience**: Streamlined upload process without OCR delays
- **Focus on Simplicity**: Users provide context through captions instead of relying on automated text extraction

**‚úÖ Technical Changes:**
- **Dependencies**: Removed OCR-related packages and dependencies
- **Upload Form**: Simplified to focus on image upload and caption only
- **API Routes**: Streamlined without OCR processing logic
- **Database**: No extracted_text field dependencies
- **Search**: Focuses on titles, captions, and metadata instead of extracted text
- **UI Components**: Clean interface without OCR progress indicators

**Rationale for Removal:**
- OCR often failed with blurry or low-quality error screenshots
- Added unnecessary complexity to the upload process
- Resource-intensive processing that slowed down uploads
- Users can provide better context through captions
- Simplified the overall user experience significantly
